		<p>Welcome to our cycling journey. This website details our summary messages that we sent to a group of close friends and family via whatsapp chat while on the road. We have copied them here so the information is available and helpful for the wider public. Thanks for reading!</p>

		<h2>Trip Motivation</h2>
		<p>On November 16th, we exit our small town in Bennekom, NL for a 1-month cycling trip. Our real final destination is Costa Rica, Elke's home country, which we would fly to. Nonetheless as we were taking our 9-year dog Lupe, we wanted to minimize her air-travels. Also Lupe's breed mix is only accepted in Iberia flights. Thus the idea originated to do a slow travel cycling trip from NL to BCN.	
		<br>	
		<h2>Trip Overview</h2>	
		<p>The fact that we were travelling with a 1 year old baby, a dog and all our gear in trailers, at the start of European winter (Nov-Dec), made us quite heavy and slow. We had an arrival date curfew of Dec 17th to Barcelona. It had been planned by design that we would skip 3 legs by train, in order to meet our deadline. We then found out dog-friendly trains are limited, and as you will see in <a href="https://allanpcampbell.github.io/blog/day-20-21/">Day #20</a> we got hit by one of the biggest strikes in France which paralyzed all public transportation for the reminder of our trip. We did managet to catch one 10min train. Other large legs we had to skip by car. The map below shows in blue what we travelled by car and in red what we cycled.

		<h2>Routing</h2>
		<p>The travelling comfort we found in this trip depended 300% on the beautiful and informative books prepared by Paul Benjaminse from <a href="https://www.cyclingeurope.nl/">Cycling Europe</a>. The dedication and attention to the user placed in every page of the book made our already complex journey smooth in terms of routing. Whenever we deviated we found trouble. Thanks Paul for all your help in this crazy dream of ours!<p>

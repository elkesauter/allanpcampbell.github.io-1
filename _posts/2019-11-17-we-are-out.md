Dear friends and family, 1 day ago (Saturday 16 Nov) we left NL by bike. We are heading to Barcelona Allan, Elkita, Paco and Lupe👫👶🐶 with 2 bikes and 2 trailers🚲🚲📦📦. After 4.5 spectacular years in The Netherlands, we are headed towards Costa Rica to another stage of our lives, close to grandparents, community and the sea 👬👭👬🚶🌊.

We would like to share our bicycle trip through this chat 💬 open to all English speakers who want to know about the trip.

This group has a dairy format (read only) solo where only Allan and Elke can send messages. So there is no obligation to answer 😅 and thus reduce # of messages⬇.

If you have anything to tell us as advice, encouragement, or questions, please send us private messages or in the other shared groups.

Feel free to leave the chat anytime or when you are tired of seeing us in the same clothes 😬 we do not want to spam. We promise to keep it short (as much as possible) and juicy 🍊.


### Whys and Hows
❓**How was the idea born**❓ <br>
Since we made the walk to Santiago Compostela = we loved slow travel.

❓**Why BCN**❓<br>
Since Lupe (because of her breed) can only fly through Iberia.

❓**Why in November**❓<br>
We wanted Paco to be 1 year old. The goal is to arrive before Christmas in Spain.

❓**Really all by bike**❓ <br>
We would love to but with 👶🐶 = 🐢. We are going to do some sections by train.

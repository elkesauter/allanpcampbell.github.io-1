Destination: Chagny, FR 
Distance: 15.7km (aborted) 
Time: 1.2hrs

Well today we had a tricky decision to make in that we got so captivated by Beaune that we (meaning Elke) really wanted to do some sightseeing 😎. We then arranged a short 25km bike ride next day to Fontaines that would enable us to tour in the morning. We went to the magnificient Hotel de Dieu with it's typical Bougogne ❤🧡💛💚 colored tiles. It was a hospital for the poor but with royal accomodations (who amongst other things in times of the plague pacients got wine instead of contaminated water 🍷). Sights 🕶✅. We then hit the supermarket where we had to change paco 2wice 🥃💩. A+E underprioritezed lunch and had a tiny quiche which would get us back later.

We finally headed out 2:40pm but weren't too hurried as there were only 25 km. WRONG. We did it all wrong ❌. By that time fog ☁ had come up, we cycled all through mystical vineyards 🍇with a Lord of the Rings feel thinking an orc 👺 will surprise us next turn. Freezing ❄temps rising quiclkly. Food energy didn't last even 30min. We were pedalling up and down hills completely power-less low on fuel⏬.

Paco woke up from his nap 4:00pm. Light dimming-nervouness getting to us. Next town came up, Chagny (not our final destination). We decided to cut our trip short ✂ and went to the first cafe ☕ to strategize. The cafe/bar was full with the old town folks hitting the bar 4pm 🥂🍻🍺🥃. Turns out the whole bar helped us plan our final leg giving us tips on trains, helping us call taxis 🚕📞 and giving us moral support 💪🏻 .

We went to Chagny train station meaning to catch a short 7mim train 🚂 to our real destination Fontaines (8km away). We are quite loaded 🧱📦 and were a bit scared of being able to put it all in the train in the short stop time span. First train, cancelled ❌. Second train, cancelled ❌. Next train delayed 30min ⌛, then 40 ⏰, then 1hr 🕰. In total we waited at the train station 2hrs. Thankfully we were fully food stocked and also with heaters. But sick to our guts wanting to arrive 🤢 now. Train arrived. Asked for help to nice Syrian guy and we successfully crammed it all in the train. Next stop Fontaines.

We arrived and had small margin for error as we were already -3°C☃❄. We had to arrive clean cut no mistakes to Airbnb. In freaking freezing cold we managed to get to address at 8pm. Home bless!

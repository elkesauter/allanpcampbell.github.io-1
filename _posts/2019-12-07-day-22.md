We wanted to make it to Lyon in the next days to meet Farmhack Anne 💙 (an incredible lady whom elke works with) who was gonna move all the way down to cycle with us for 2 days. The courage🦁! BUT We were moving too slow. We were approaching a leg which was not cycle friendly (shared path with cars🚲🚛). All trains cancelled till the 14th. At some point we would need to make another jump forward and we were getting tempted by warm temperatures and sun in the south of France☀. We pain in ❣ (as this would mean meeting Anne note possible) decided it was time to move forward ⏩. We found an amazing rental company Rent and Drop and rented a van 5km from where we were staying and we able to rent one way and drop in Montpellier saving Allan driving time😅. We bought an emergency second hand baby seat 👶 and road trip started! We had unlimited kms woop!

First stop was in Lyon for some admin paperwork printing 📄 for Elke. Only to discover that day Lyon hosted La Fête des Lumières 💛💡🕯.

The tough part was that it started at 8pm and there were no hotels or accomodations available in Lyon. Elke worked her magic and got a place in Vienne 50km from Lyon. Paco napped, then picnic in the van and then light festival ❤🧡💛💚💙💜. It was packed and there was so much police and military 👮🏻and some small manifestations which had us a bit on edge, but we finally got to a beautiful show in a gorgeous plaza with a horse statue 🐎 . It was glamorously lit and featured underwater creatures floating in the air with great soundtrack. Paco with big eyes already, had them about to pop 👀 . We were wondering what is he recording in his subconscious 🤔🧠 after seeing all this. That was all we needed, a taste of it and we left. We really enjoyed it and off to Vienne happy to have a bed to sleep in.

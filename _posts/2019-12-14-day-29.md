Today we made a choice that will have its sequel as you will see in next post. But this is part 1 📗. We derouted from Paul Benjaminse's route 😱. Elke is not a fan of the roads shared with cars and it seemed from Google Street images this part had some of these. [We will later find out that this was not the case-even if car road, very few cars pass by this route]. Also Paul's route went by the mountains ⛰slowly finding the Pyrenees. Even though he had advised us to stop at certain point before reaching full Pyrenees due to trailers, this part was still theoretically doable by us. But still it had quite a slope and we were doubting if we could do it with our weight. By the way, the plan was to somehow arrive close to the city of Perpignan were we will rent a van to cross the Pyrenees.

ALSO, googles alternative rute was a flat route that also passed by a natural park where you cycled along a thin strip of land in between two lagoons and the ocean in the background. We hadn't seen the ocean yet 🌊 and were a tempted by that geographical uniqueness. Finally, in two days this route would leave us quite close to Perpignan (13 km away) easy enough for Allan to bike to rent the van. The mountain route alternative will still leave him 25km away. Although there was a bus from Estagel, the national strike status has left us pretty immobilized by public transport. For all the reasons above we opted for google's national park route 📍.

Before leaving the Airbnb Allan did a tire repair for Elke's trailer. We were unsure if it had a puncture or if it was the valve. We had to inflate it every cycly day for the past week as it lost a bit of air each night. The pool served it's good use to find a tiny miniscule rupture 💧🛁🧐. Trailer fixed and thankfully first puncture in the trip 🙏🏻.

We headed out. The main goal for today was to make it early enough (with sunlight) to the strip were three waters border strip of road. The cycle today was all bordering the Canal du Robin and 70% of it was within the Narbonnaise National Park 🌲. So few car risk, immersed in nature. Due to gravel road we were slow(er) but we made it just in time to the strip! We were quite happy of the victory of the race against the sun 💪🏻. Night fell short after. We still had 6km to pedal in the park before arriving to our destination Port-la-Nouvelle. It was a beautiful sight when admist the trees 🌳🌳🌳🌳, there appeared the first glimpse of port lights 🔦 first reflected in the canal water next to us. Such a comforting feeling when you see the light from the distance that welcomes you into the new towns walls 💛💛💛.

We arrived to the Port and booked the first hotel with big lighted sign: Hotel Restaurant Du Port ⚓🚢.

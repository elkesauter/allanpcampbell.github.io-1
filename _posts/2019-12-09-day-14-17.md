Good morning friends! Sorry for msg backlog. We have been doing quite some logistics and strategizing the past days as one crew member has aborted mission 🐶 (she is fine just not enjoying trailer). Past days too much brain 🧠 time not much writing ✏ and flow time. Below past days posts read when time. Happy weekend to all 💛.

Allan went up down in out 🇩🇪 🇧🇪 🇫🇷 🇱🇺 🇪🇸 in these 5 days😅 with some interesting blah blah dudes a Belgian constructor pirate and a dancing guy from Togo 😄. Meanwhile E+P got some good walking practice. Lupe was left in great hands and warm company.

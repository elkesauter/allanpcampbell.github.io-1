Origin: Fontaines, FR <br>
Destination: Dracy le Fort, FR <br>
Distance: 7.2 km (aborted) <br>
Time: 1hr <br>

We stayed 2 nights in Fontaines to refuge from the cold. We got to know the entire town by heart, the supermarket and the hotel/bar.

In the bar we got a sandwich and hot chocolate 🍫☕ and found out that the country was on strike 📛and all public transport was stopped. At the supermarket the owner gave Paco a red balloon which was a hit 🎈.

On our departure day we decided wake up early 🦆and hit the road early to have more margin for error since we got a bit scared by the cold on the last ride. This day the weather promised to be 9°C so we were enthusiastic. We woke up early as planned and hit the road. The early bird plan did not turn out as we expected. The temperature was still freezing due to fog and since Paco did not have his morning ritual time. Thus he 💩while sleeping in the trailer which woke him up. We wanted to go to a cafe or bar or restaurant to get something warm change paco and strategize how to proceed. However there were NONE NIET NIENTE in town. As temperatures were not rising and Paco already awake and wanting to be outside we aborted cycling again 🚳 and just got the nearest hotel where we were, Dracy le Fort.

The hotel owner was a cyclist himself 🚲❤so he gave a discount 💳and we (who seldom go to restaurants) had an exquisite spectacular fenomenal delicious french dinner at the restaurant 🍽👌🏻.

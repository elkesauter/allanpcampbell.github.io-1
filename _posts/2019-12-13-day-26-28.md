Origin: Beziers, FR <br>
Destination: St-Marcel-sur-Aude, FR <br>
Distance: 40.9km <br>
Time: 4.75hr <br>

We spent two days at the elders residence🐰. Elke got 'em biking bluesssssss 🛵🏎😕. Maybe the rainy day, maybe the fear of next part of the route (included some car roads), or maybe body in need of meat🥩? I was finding trouble getting full throttle 🧨💣for next chapter. Nothing like finding AND booking a super airbnb with friendly host, top notch amenities & pool, and cheap to shake them blues off. We also hit the local town fair (yesterday evening closed) where we had a dosis of churro n' crepe and Paco had a taste of the fair rides. Paco also getting quite the hang of being bipedal human🦶🦶.

Next we headed out towards St. Marcel-sur-Aude. The sun also showed itself quite prominent this day! The first part of the route had one of most iconic pieces of the whole journey-an old bridge ⛩that carries the Canal du Midi. We couldn't believe we were cycling up that gem of history and that we had such a cool starting point, the triple view of: a) the river beneath us b) the canal next tu us c) the city of Beziers in the background 💕.

Again we had a really smooth ride. Great weather, passing along pretty medieval mini towns, no route mishaps. We were quite slow the first part due to gravel and wind against us and took 3 hours for 15km-had 18 more to go. We thought we were gonna hit the night and arrive super late. But we got speedy gonzales going 🐹💨 and did them in 1 hr!! arriving quite timely to the 🤩 airbnb!

Here we will stay 2 days again doing logistics stuff for our arrival in BCN. OMG it's getting to that point yes!

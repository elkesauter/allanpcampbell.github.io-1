## We are out

Dear friends and family, 2 days ago (Saturday 16 Nov) we left NL by bike. We are heading to Barcelona Allan, Elkita, Paco and Lupe👫👶🐶 with 2 bikes and 2 trailers🚲🚲📦📦. After 4.5 spectacular years in The Netherlands, we are headed towards Costa Rica to another stage of our lives, close to grandparents, community and the sea 👬👭👬🚶🌊.

We would like to share our bicycle trip through this chat 💬 open to all English speakers who want to know about the trip.

This group has a dairy format (read only) solo where only Allan and Elke can send messages. So there is no obligation to answer 😅 and thus reduce # of messages⬇.

If you have anything to tell us as advice, encouragement, or questions, please send us private messages or in the other shared groups.

Feel free to leave the chat anytime or when you are tired of seeing us in the same clothes 😬 we do not want to spam. We promise to keep it short (as much as possible) and juicy 🍊.

### What about videos?

Videos are an awesome way to show off your work in a more engaging and personal way, and we’ve made sure they work great on our themes. Just paste an embed code from YouTube or Vimeo, and the theme makes sure it displays perfectly:

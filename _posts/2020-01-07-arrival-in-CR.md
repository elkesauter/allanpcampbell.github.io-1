After BCN we got reunited with Elke's family and Allan's youngest brother and wife. We did a complot to celebrate the entry to new year and decade in the EU and say goodbye to the old continent in Portugal 🥂🥳. Pure good old family time!

The reason we write this message today is because yesterday was the real trip end. Yesterday we flew from Madrid to Costa Rica, following what our ancestors had done a while back. This is not only the end but it is why it all started: to bring Lupe to Madrid as she can only fly with Iberia to Costa Rica. We have now arrived to the tropics!

This message serves as a double dip 🍦🍦. First as the last documentation of our bike end and CR arrival. Then to send our best wishes for you all for this new year and decade 2020. Third, thanks for reading along and being personally interested in our adventure. Fourth we will be waiting in Costa Rica amongst with other beings 🐸🐠🦀☀ 😉.

Finally if anyone is interested in the route or others across Europe, be sure to check the website and books of Paul Benjaminse here: www.cyclingeurope.nl. We just bought his books and sent over a few questions by email and he was the kindest wisest most savy route cyclist we could ever find. Thanks Paul!

Cheers from the garden and strong beats 💓 to all!
